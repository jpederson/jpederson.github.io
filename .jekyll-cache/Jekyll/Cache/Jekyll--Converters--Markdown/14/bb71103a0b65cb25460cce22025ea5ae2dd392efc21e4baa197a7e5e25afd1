I"<p>Every creative project has a moment when it really starts moving â€” a moment when an idea really ignites your creativity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iâ€™m addicted to that moment when a project <strong>leaps</strong> from zero to one percent completion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Itâ€™s in the spirit of those moments that I start this blog. Itâ€™ll be an outlet for my thoughts, design tips, blobs of code and documentation of the work I do.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading â€” hopefully weâ€™ll be seeing more of each other soon!</p>
