Every creative project has a moment when it really starts moving. A moment when an idea really ignites your creativity.

> I'm addicted to that moment when a project **leaps** from zero to one percent completion.

It's in the spirit of those moments that I start this blog. It'll be an outlet for my thoughts, design tips, blobs of code and documentation of the work I do. Thanks for reading &mdash; hopefully we'll be seeing more of each other soon!
